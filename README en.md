PowerKit is a team of volunteers united for one goal: manufacturing free power banks for UAF servicemen. We utilize batteries from used electronic cigarettes as power banksâ€™ battery cells.

PowerKit project was founded on the first weeks of the full-scale russian invasion of Ukraine. Only 5 friends had been working on the project since its start. More than 100 volunteers from various Ukrainian cities and even other countries joined the project later on.

Project goal: to provide free, powerful and convenient power banks to UAF servicemen. Our power banks are equipped with a red LED strip, USB outputs and a connector for charging handheld transceivers.

The project also serves ecological purposes: recycling electronic cigarettes. Such cigarettes have lithium batteries inside and by their properties they fit for making powerful power banks.
